Manual monitoring of satellite imagery is difficult and time-consuming.

This project automates the entire workflow using Machine Learning and Remote Sensing techniques to:

✅ Classify land cover types  
✅ Detect land changes across years  
✅ Analyze land percentage distribution  
✅ Predict future land use trends  

---

- Land transformation

---

## ✅ NDVI Feature Engineering

Uses:

NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

to improve vegetation classification accuracy.

---

## ✅ CA-Markov Future Prediction

Predicts future land cover maps using:

- Transition probabilities
- Spatial neighborhood influence
- Cellular Automata + Markov Chain

---

# 🌱 NDVI Calculation

NDVI helps distinguish vegetation from non-vegetation areas.

```python
ndvi = (nir - red) / (nir + red + 1e-10)
```

---

# 📊 Land Cover Classes

| Class ID | Land Type |
|----------|-----------|
| 0 | Forest |
| 1 | Water |
| 2 | Urban |
| 3 | Grassland |
| 4 | Desert |
| 5 | Cropland |
| 6 | Bare Soil |

---

# 🔄 Change Detection

Pixel-wise comparison is performed between classified images.

```python
change_map = (img1 != img2).astype(np.uint8)
```

This identifies:

- Stable regions
- Changed regions
- Urban growth areas
- Vegetation reduction

---

# 🔮 Future Prediction using CA-Markov

## What is CA-Markov?

CA-Markov combines:

### 🔹 Markov Chain

Models land transition probabilities over time.

### 🔹 Cellular Automata

Adds spatial neighborhood influence.

Together they generate realistic future land cover predictions.

---

# 📈 Prediction Process

1. Compute transition matrix
2. Analyze class conversion probabilities
3. Apply spatial neighborhood rules
4. Generate future land map

---

# 🖥️ Streamlit Dashboard

The project includes a fully interactive dashboard.
